# Prime Sifting

#### _C#, .NET: Prime Sifting, 9/26/2019_

## Description
Create a console application which given a number, write a method that returns all of the prime numbers less than that number.

## About this Application:
I used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to solve this.

Here is how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works to find a number up to a given number:

- Create a list of numbers from 2 through n: 2, 3, 4, ..., `number`.
- Initially, let `prime` equal 2, the first `prime` number.
- Starting from `prime`, remove all multiples of prime from the list.
- Increment `prime` by 1.
- When you reach `number`, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes.
